Jedi Academy jagamex86.dll Proxy
================================

A DLL that emulates Jedi Academy's jagamex86.dll, forwarding function calls.

Since Jedi Academy's source code has now been released this project is of no more use; just use [OpenJK](https://github.com/JACoders/OpenJK/) which comes with support for per-mod `jagamex86.dll` and the source code to it.

Usage
-----

* Rename the original `jagamex86.dll` in GameData/ to `original_jagamex86.dll`. **Do not overwrite it!**
* Put the proxy `jagamex86.dll` you compiled in GameData/

Creating mods
-------------

See SPCodeMod for an example.
